## What is Grunt/Gulp?

Grunt and Gulp are task-based command line tools for javascript projects. These tools can be used to build projects as well as expose helpful commands.

Note:
Make sure that the audience understands what grunt does, let them know how and
why grunt can help from a dev ops perspective with development of any sort of
web based project.
